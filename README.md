# Summary
Some analysis of Mafia players numbers on MTGS, 2010-2020. Included is the raw data and scripts used to marshall it into useful numbers. This is not expected to be neat. See requirements.txt for required pip packages. 

# Usage:
1. Run Generatefiles.py to touch all the Input files
1. Manually copy/paste the player lists from games in each quarter into the matching input file
    * All prefixing numbers/punctuation will be stripped, so don't worry too much about cleaning the data.
    * Essentially each non-blank line will be counted as a player. Blank lines are ignored.
1. Run playercount.py to read the Input files, perform some cleaning, ignore duplicates and copy them into a .xlsx spreadsheet
1. Run sortPlayers.py to convert the data generated by playercount.py into the three player groups
1. Generate a graph using whatever spreadsheet method you like
